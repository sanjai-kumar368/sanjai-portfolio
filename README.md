## Motivation Behind the Project
The motivation for creating this repository was to strengthen my understanding of frontend fundamentals by building small, focused projects.  
Instead of working on one large application, this repository showcases multiple mini projects that individually demonstrate specific concepts and layouts.

This approach helped me:
- Practice HTML and CSS consistently
- Understand how different layouts are structured
- Improve visual design sense
- Learn how to organize multiple projects under a single portfolio
